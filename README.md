# BirdCLEF 2025: Bird Species Identification through Acoustic Signatures

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the [BirdCLEF 2025 Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025), where the challenge was to identify under-studied bird species using their acoustic signatures. The goal was to process continuous audio data and build reliable classifiers for species recognition across taxonomic groups, even with limited labeled data. My approach earned a **bronze medal**, a **top 100 leaderboard position**, and significant community recognition, including over **1.3k views**, **70+ forks**, and a spot in **Kaggle's Top 10 Trending Notebooks**.

## Project Description
The solution began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the audio dataset, followed by experimentation with various deep learning models. I ultimately developed an ensemble approach combining EfficientNet-B0 with other deep learning architectures. This method effectively tackled the challenge of species identification, contributing to biodiversity monitoring efforts like those in Colombia's Magdalena Valley lowlands.

### Key Achievements
- **Top 100** on the BirdCLEF 2025 leaderboard
- **Bronze Medal** winner
- **1.3k+ views** and **70+ forks** on Kaggle
- Featured in **Kaggle Top 10 Trending Notebooks**
